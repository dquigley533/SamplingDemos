    "# Multicanonical Sampling (MUCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In basic multicanonical sampling we attempt to bias our sampling of each energy _macrostate_ (i.e. histogram bin) such that all energies are visited with equal probability, i.e. a \"flat\" histogram. We can then adjust the weight of generated samples to reconstruct statistics at any temperature of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of visiting a particular energy is;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P\\left(U\\right) = g\\left(U\\right) \\frac{ \\exp{[-\\beta U]} }{Z} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g(U)$ is the density of states in energy, i.e. the number of microstates which have than energy. In physics we're more used to thinking of the logarithm of this quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S(U) = k_B \\ln{g\\left(U\\right)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is known as the _entropy_ (strictly speaking the Boltzmann entropy). \n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a flat histogram we augment the energy $U$ with a bias $V(U)$ such that the probability of visiting energy $U$ at temperature $T$ is now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{P}\\left(U\\right) = g(U) \\frac{  \\exp{[-\\beta ( U + V(U) ) ]} }{Z} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose $V(U) = k_B T \\ln{P(\\left(U\\right)}$ (sometimes known as Boltzmann inversion) then conveniently $\\tilde{P}(U)=1$ and we'll acheive uniform sampling in energy as desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "[As an aside, the quanity $A(U) = -k_B T \\ln{P(\\left(U\\right)}$ defines the Helmholtz _free_ energy as a function of $U$ and hence in other contexts (chemistry) variations on this theme are referred to as free energy calculation. In such contexts we might be biasing to produce flat histograms in some observable other than energy, but only obtain statistics for a single temperature. See metadynamics, umbrella sampling etc.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we don't know $P(\\left(U\\right)$ _a priori_ and so need an iterative procedure. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with $V(U)=0$ for all $U$ and run a standard canonical Monte Carlo simulation as in the last workbook.\n",
    "2. Use the resulting $P(\\left(U\\right)$ to estimate the optimal $V(U)$. This will be a poor estimate for regions of $U$ that are so unprobable at the current $T$ that we have sampled poorly there.\n",
    "3. Run a new MC simulation with the current bias $V(U)$. Construct an improved estimate of $P(U)$ from the resulting $\\tilde{P}\\left(U\\right)$ via _histogram reweighting_. \n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat steps 2 and 3 until we produce a histogram which is close to flat, and then run a final simulation sampling all quanitities of interest which can then be reweighted to give statistics at any temperature of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reweighting at step 3 is straightforward. We've generated $\\tilde{P}\\left(U\\right)$ by counting all samples that land in each histogram bin with a weight of 1. Instead we count each sample $i$ with weight $w_i = \\exp{[\\beta V(U_i)]}$ where $U_i$ is the energy of sample $i$ recognising that;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(U_i) = \\tilde{P}(U_i) w_i $$\n",
